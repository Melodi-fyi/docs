## Welcome

## Authentication

To access our external apis you’ll need an api key. You’ll need to use your private (as opposed to publishable) api key for these apis. You can find or generate an api key under settings in the Melodi App.

The api key is passed as a query parameter when making calls to the api. For example `https://app.melodi.fyi/api/external/experiments/1/feedback?apiKey=abc-123`
