## Overview

Melodi enables teams to quickly collect feedback from expert reviewers. This feedback can be either positive or negative, and can be enriched with custom attributes that you define in your project settings (like "incorrect", "helpful", or "source issue").

To add feedback to a session, you can either:
- Use the feedback button on the session card in the Melodi UI
- Integrate the Melodi feedback widget into your application
- Use the [feedback API](/api-reference/create-feedback) with your own custom UI

### Feedback Attributes

You can customize feedback attributes from the Settings page to match your specific review needs. Each piece of feedback can include:
- A positive or negative rating
- Optional feedback text
- Custom attributes you've defined
- Association with specific messages or entire threads

All feedback will be visible on both the individual session page and aggregated in the Melodi dashboard for analysis.
