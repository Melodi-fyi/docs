## Overview

User intents represent what the user was trying to do during a session. For example, a user intent could be "create a new account" or "find a product".

User intents can be tagged manually at any time or can be configured to automatically tag new sessions.

## Creating a new user intent

User intents can be created in two ways.

**1. The "Create new intent" button on the Intents page**

**2. Creating a new intent directly on a thread**

## Tagging an existing intent

You can also tag an existing intent on a session. This is useful if you want to tag an intent that you've already identified in a session.

## Setting up automatic monitoring

Every intent can be converted into an "active" intent, meaning that new sessions will be automatically tagged with this intent.

To enable automatic tagging, follow these steps:

1. First, create a new user intent (using either method described above)
2. Manually tag **at least 5 example sessions** with this intent
3. On the Intents page, click the "Analyze" button and wait a few minutes.
4. Once active, new incoming sessions will be automatically tagged (most sessions are tagged within 1 hour, all sessions are tagged within 24 hours)

Tags added by Melodi's AI are marked with a âœ¨ icon. You can hover over the tag to see who assigned it, and you can always remove a tag if it's incorrect.
