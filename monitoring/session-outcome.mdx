## What is Session Outcome?

Session Outcome is a key metric provided by Melodi designed to give you an immediate understanding of your AI agent's performance from the perspective of user experience. In essence, it estimates whether a user had an overall positive interaction with your agent during a specific session.

Think of it as an automated way to gauge user satisfaction, especially helpful because direct user feedback (like thumbs up/down ratings) is often sparse. While explicit feedback is valuable, it typically represents only a small fraction (often 1-20%) of total user sessions. Session Outcome bridges this gap by providing an estimated user experience score for *every* session, even those without explicit feedback.

This allows you to monitor user experience trends consistently across your entire user base without requiring any additional setup or instrumentation.

## How does it work?

Melodi calculates Session Outcome by analyzing the conversation within each session. It looks at several factors:

1.  **Agent Responses:** The relevance and quality of the agent's answers in relation to the user's queries.
2.  **Conversation Flow:** How the interaction progresses â€“ does the user seem to achieve their goal, or do they appear frustrated or stuck?
3.  **Explicit Feedback:** If the user *did* provide feedback (e.g., a rating or comment), this is heavily weighted in the calculation.
4.  **Other Contextual Clues:** Factors like session length, user actions, and repetition can also inform the outcome score.

By combining these elements, Melodi generates a score that reflects the likely overall experience of the user during that session.

## Why is it important?

*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Get a view of user experience across *all* sessions, not just those with feedback.
*   **Identify Problem Areas:** Quickly spot sessions or trends indicating poor user experience, allowing you to investigate and improve your agent.
*   **Track Improvements:** Measure the impact of changes you make to your agent on overall user satisfaction.
*   **No Setup Required:** Gain valuable insights out-of-the-box.

From a data science perspective, Session Outcome is an online, automated evaluation performed by a Large Language Model (LLM). It functions similarly to "Answer Relevance" evaluations commonly used in LLM assessments.

The core mechanism involves:

1.  **Session Data Ingestion:** Melodi processes the logged messages and metadata for each user session.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Relevant features are extracted, including conversational turns, message content, timestamps, and any explicit user feedback signals or assigned attributes.
3.  **LLM Evaluation:** A specialized LLM prompt is constructed, incorporating the session context. The LLM is tasked with evaluating the session against criteria related to helpfulness, relevance, and indicators of user satisfaction or frustration, ultimately outputting a score or classification representing the session's outcome.
4.  **Calibration:** The model's output is calibrated using available explicit feedback data to improve the accuracy of the estimation for sessions *without* explicit feedback.

While inspired by Answer Relevance, the Session Outcome model goes beyond turn-by-turn relevance to assess the holistic quality of the interaction and estimate the user's overall experience. It provides a practical, real-time proxy for user satisfaction in the common scenario where direct feedback is limited.
