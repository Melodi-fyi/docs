## Overview

Issues represent problems or errors that occur during a session. For example, an issue could be "payment failed" or "signup error".

Issues can be tagged manually at any time or can be configured to automatically detect new problems in your sessions.

## Creating a new issue

Issues can be created in two ways.

**1. The "Create new issue" button on the Issues page**

**2. Creating a new issue directly on a session**

## Tagging an existing issue

You can also tag an existing issue on a session. This is useful if you want to tag an issue that you've already identified in a session.

## Setting up automatic monitoring

Every issue can be converted into an "active" monitor, meaning that new sessions will be automatically scanned for this type of problem.
