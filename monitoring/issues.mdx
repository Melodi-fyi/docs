## Overview

Issue Monitoring is a feature of [Melodi Intelligence](./intelligence-overview) that allows you to define and automatically track specific, problematic scenarios or patterns occurring in user sessions.

An "Issue" represents any category of interaction you want to flag for review or quantification, such as:

*   Agent errors (e.g., hallucinations, incorrect information, citing stale data)
*   User difficulties (e.g., expressing frustration, asking repetitive questions, failing to complete a task)
*   Process failures (e.g., payment errors, integration timeouts)

**Why monitor Issues?**

*   **Proactive Detection:** Automatically identify known failure modes.
*   **Quantify Impact:** Understand the frequency and scope of specific problems.
*   **Track Fixes:** Measure the effectiveness of agent improvements or process changes aimed at reducing the issue.
*   **Prioritize:** Focus efforts on the most frequent or impactful issues.

Similar to User Intents, you first define an Issue and provide examples, then enable automatic monitoring.

## Defining & Tagging Issues Manually

Before automatic monitoring can be set up, you need to define the types of issues you want to track and provide examples.

Issues can be created and tagged in several ways:

### Creating a New Issue

**1. From the Issues Page:** Use the "Create new issue" button.

**2. Directly on a Session:** Create an issue while reviewing a specific problematic session.

### Tagging an Existing Issue

You can manually apply an already defined issue tag to any relevant session. Providing clear examples is key to effective automatic monitoring.

## Setting up Automatic Issue Monitoring

Once an issue is defined and you have manually tagged several representative examples, you can enable automatic monitoring.

Melodi's AI will learn to identify sessions exhibiting similar patterns based on your examples. Newly ingested sessions will then be automatically scanned and tagged if they match a monitored issue pattern.

<Note>Automatic Issue Monitoring currently requires activation by the Melodi team. Please contact us at info@melodi.app with the issues you'd like to activate for monitoring after defining them and tagging at least 5-10 examples.</Note>

This feature helps you scale your monitoring efforts beyond manual review, ensuring known problems are consistently tracked over time.
