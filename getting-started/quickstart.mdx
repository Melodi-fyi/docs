You can get started with Melodi in less than 10 minutes. First, you'll need to send session data to Melodi, which you can do with the following options:
* [React component](/integrating-melodi-analytics/react-component)
* [Python and Typescript SDKs](/integrating-melodi-analytics/sdks)
* [Direct API integration](/api-reference/create_thread)

Once you've sent data to Melodi, you can set up automatic intent monitoring and start exploring your data in the Melodi UI.
