All feedback submitted by end-users lands in the **Feedback Inbox** within the Melodi dashboard.

This centralized location serves multiple important purposes:

*   **Review & QA:** Internal teams can easily review incoming user feedback for accuracy, consistency, and potential labeling errors.
*   **User Outreach:** Treat critical or actionable feedback as opportunities for direct user engagement, similar to support tickets or NPS follow-ups. Understand the full context of the feedback by viewing the session associated with it.
*   **Identify Trends:** Spot recurring themes, usability issues, or common points of confusion highlighted by aggregated user feedback.

Effectively utilizing the Feedback Inbox allows you to close the loop with users and ensure the quality of the feedback data being collected.
