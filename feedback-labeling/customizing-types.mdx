Melodi uses a primary `feedbackType` which is typically "Positive" or "Negative". Beyond this, you can define custom **feedback attributes** to capture detailed evaluations tailored to your project's needs. These attributes are configured in your project settings.

You can define various feedback attributes and their corresponding value sets, such as:

*   **Attribute:** `Star Rating`
    *   **Values:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (stars)
*   **Attribute:** `Quality Score`
    *   **Values:** "Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"
*   **Attribute:** `User Sentiment`
    *   **Values:** "Happy", "Neutral", "Frustrated"
*   **Attribute:** `Content Relevance`
    *   **Values:** "Relevant", "Partially Relevant", "Irrelevant"
*   **Attribute:** `Task Completion`
    *   **Values:** "Goal Achieved", "Goal Not Achieved"
*   *Any other categorical or numerical attribute relevant to your analysis (e.g., `Humor Level`: "High", `Issue Type`: "Hallucination").*

This flexibility with attributes allows you to capture nuanced evaluations beyond the binary `feedbackType`, tailoring the labeling process to your specific AI agent and goals.

When creating a feedback record, it's required to include either a `feedbackType` or at least one custom `attribute`. Providing both, or multiple attributes, is also supported.

When feedback is collected via the API or React component, you will specify the `feedbackType` (e.g., "POSITIVE") and any relevant custom `attributes` you have configured (e.g., `{"Star Rating": 5, "Quality Score": "Excellent"}`).
