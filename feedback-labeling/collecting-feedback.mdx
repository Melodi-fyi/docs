Data labels, universally referred to as "Feedback" within Melodi, can be collected from two primary sources:

1.  **End-Users (via your Application):**
    *   **Melodi React Component:** A convenient, drop-in component for adding feedback buttons (like thumbs up/down) directly to your UI. ([See Component Docs](/integrating-melodi-analytics/react-component))
    *   **Feedback API:** Integrate Melodi's feedback endpoint with your own custom feedback interface (e.g., star ratings, surveys). ([See API Docs](/api-reference/create-feedback))

2.  **Internal Teams (via Melodi Dashboard):**
    *   Your internal subject matter experts, QA teams, or data labelers can review sessions directly within the Melodi platform and add feedback/labels.

## Explicit vs. Implicit Feedback

Melodi supports collecting both explicit and implicit feedback signals via the API, primarily through the Feedback API endpoint:

*   **Explicit Feedback:** Direct ratings or comments provided consciously by the user (e.g., clicking thumbs up).
*   **Implicit Feedback:** Signals derived from user behavior that indicate success or failure, sent via the API (e.g., user accepts an AI-generated recommendation, user clicks "add to cart" after an interaction, user immediately closes the chat window).

You can differentiate these using custom feedback attributes when sending data to the API, allowing you to track both direct sentiment and behavioral outcomes.
