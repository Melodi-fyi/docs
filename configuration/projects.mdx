title: Projects
---

Projects are the primary unit of organization inside Melodi. Each project normally represents **one concrete AI agent**—for example:

* A customer-facing support copilot
* An internal sales-assistant bot
* A staging / QA clone of your production assistant

Because of this, it’s common for the same company to maintain multiple projects, one per product and/or environment (e.g. *support-prod*, *support-qa*).

## Creating a project

1. Open the **Project overview** screen in the Melodi web application.
2. Click **Add project**.
3. Provide a name

That’s it—your new project is ready to start receiving data.

## How projects affect analytics

All dashboards, charts, and metrics inside Melodi are automatically **scoped to the currently-selected project**. This lets you drill-down into the behaviour of a single agent or environment without noise from the rest of your organisation.

However, **end-user records are cross-project**:

* If the same user talks to multiple agents (or the same agent across environments) their entire history is visible from a single *user* page.
* From a monitoring dashboard point-of-view you will still be looking at **one project at a time**.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a dedicated project for every AI agent you ship.
2. Optionally create a second project for QA / staging traffic.
3. Switch the active project from the header whenever you need to inspect a different agent.
