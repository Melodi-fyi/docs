title: User management
---

This page covers **admin-level access control** inside the Melodi web application. It is *not* about end-users who interact with your AI agents—that is handled automatically via the API and visible in *User* records.

## Where to manage users

1. Navigate to **Settings → Organization settings**.
2. Open the **Organization users** section.

From here you can:

* **Invite** additional teammates (they will receive an email sign-up link).
* **Remove** users who no longer need access.
* **Change roles** for existing members.

## Roles & permissions

Role-based access control is simple:

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| **Admin** | Full access to all projects and settings in the Melodi web application. |
| **Owner** | All permissions of Admin, plus the ability to invite and remove users. |
